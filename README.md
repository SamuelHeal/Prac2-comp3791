# Practical 2 - Comp3791

## Intitial Prompt

```
ROLE:
You are an expert Java programmer, tasked with completing a race team management simulation.

TASK:
The system allows users to customise race cars with different engines, tyres, and aerodynamic features. It also includes a strategy optimiser to plan pit stops, fuel usage, and tyre changes based on race conditions such as track type, weather, and distance.

KEY FEATURES:
Car Customisation: Users can select and upgrade components like engines (e.g., standard, turbocharged), tyres (soft, medium, hard), and aerodynamic kits*(see page 3). Each choice affects performance metrics such as speed, fuel efficiency, and handling.

Race Strategy Optimisation: Users can input race details (track length, weather, fuel capacity, etc.) to generate an optimal pit stop and tyre change strategy for a minimum of 5 race tracks. Your program should take into account factors such as wear rates, and fuel consumption based on the selected car components.

We will customise further after the initial setup
